 Some people have asked me to put the JNOS 2.0 sources on github, so here you go.

 The official JNOS 2.0 site will always be :

   https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2

The src directory is the latest 2.0m release with the 2.0n.beta update already
added to it. So when you are reading the docs/changes.txt, just skip over the
part that says this update is only available as a patch, blah, blah, and jump
directly to the part that says to edit your config.h (or config.h.default),
and make sure this entry exists :

   #define GET_PASSWORD_FROM_J2PWMGR
