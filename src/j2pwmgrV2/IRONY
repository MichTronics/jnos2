 Damn - just when I've completed the new hash stuff, only
 to find that the Winlink challenge code requires a clear
 text password as part of the buffer BEFORE the MD5 hash.

 Going backwards now ?

 Yup, so this is a bit of show stopper (for WL2K password stuff) ...

 How to do this now ?

  Let's be fair, the logistics of changing all the winlink systems
  away from the use of cleartext is overwhelming, one simply needs
  to acknowledge that. I've talked to them about it, and agree :|

  I have probably gotten carried away with how I encrypt the CMS
  password, especially if there is only one password to do, it's
  not like there is a whole bunch of them, just one entry now.

  but, it has actually been an excellent education, in that I am
  more aware of the latest technologies for encryption of stuff.
